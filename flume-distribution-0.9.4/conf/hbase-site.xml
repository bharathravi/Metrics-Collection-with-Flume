     The following three properties are used together to create the list of
     host:peer_port:leader_port quorum servers for ZooKeeper.

  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>fm-vm-010</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
      For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
      By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
      of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
      list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
      this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.
